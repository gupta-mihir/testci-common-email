README.md

This program was setup how Professor Foyzul set it up in the demo video, using jdk 11.0.9, Maven project, on Eclipse.
The full directory is in the submission .zip, the the path you want to follow to get to the 4 .java files I have made
(EmailConcrete.java, as well as my Test.java files) will be: commons-email-1.3.2-src\src\test\java\org\apache\commons\mail

All of the functions run and compile with no issues. I have commented, for convinience, the latest test coverages 
I had for each of the methods required to test. There were some methods that required more than one test case, test function,
I commented those accordingly, and the name of the functions should also be easy to tell which method they belong to. 

To run, simply right click on commons-email, build project, and click coverage as JUnit Test. That should be all that is required
to run the project, given that jdk 11.0.9 and maven are already set up.
